# skin.aeonmq6.mod

Modded version of Kodi skin AeonMQ6
---

#####Original skin by MarcosQui

#####Original mod by Angelinas

This version is modded for streaming radio support via my kodi addon script.radio.streaming.helper (https://github.com/the-black-eagle/script.radio.streaming.helper)

If you replace the original script.cu.lrclyrics with my modded version it will search lyrics for every song without having to switch in and out of the full screen window - script is at https://github.com/the-black-eagle/script.cu.lrclyrics

With the skin installed, the modded lyrics script (don't forget to turn off lrc lyrics as there is no timing info in a radio stream !!) and the streaming helper, you should get a screen that is almost exactly the same as when playing music from your local library.  Certainly it's as close as I can get for a radio stream.
